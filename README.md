## üìù General Information
"Photon Fusion Prototype" is a prototype of an online game in Unity, created using the Photon Fusion platform. The game offers first-person gameplay, where players can join the game by providing their unique nicknames and room id.

In-game, players' nicknames are visible above their characters. The player can display a table (TAB) with the room id and players' ping. The gameplay involves moving around the map, shooting projectiles and pushing opponents away. Server notifications notify players when other players join, when players leave the game, and when other players are hit.

The project focuses on demonstrating skills in network game programming and data synchronization. This is a prototype intended to demonstrate the implementation of network functions using Photon Fusion, constituting a starting point for the possible development of a full-fledged network game.

## ‚ú® Game Features
List of features that the game includes.
- Rooms with id
- Joining the server as a host or client automatically
- Object synchronization in real time
- Player nicknames
- Host migration
- Table with list of players and ping
- Server notifications
- Shooting other players
- Keyboard and gamepad control

## üí° Learning Goals
- How to create an online game using photon fusion
- How to use the input system with photon fusion
- Instantiation of objects on the network
- Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)
- Host migration system
- Understanding the client-server model
